		<p id="brand">Gojira RT-7
		<br> $13,000</p>
		<p id="description">Years of playing street racing games and watching actioin movies
		has turned this car into a coveted dream car for many young people. This car's ascension 
		to the status of Drift God was brought about by its domination of the street racing scene 
		in the late 90s. This hot set of wheels is famed for its perfect drifts. Able to furiously
		powerslide around a corner at an angle of &#960/6 radians. On top of this, every incarnation
		of the RT-7 comes out of the box with a variety of interchangeable parts. Bumpers, spoilers, rims, 
		hoods and sideskirt variants are included with the stock car along with the obligatory widebody
		kit and nitrous boosters. This legendary import can be yours for 130 Benjamins.

		<p id="brand">Deslizador Malo Gato
		<br> $50,000</p>
		<p id="description">To say that this is a great car is an almost offensive 
		understatement. The Malo Gato is a masterpiece of automation. 830 lb-ft of torgue,
		670 horsepower, 0 to 60 in 0.05 minutes, and a top speed of 9400 centimeters per 
		second. Year after year this model of the Deslizador line has consistently won awards 
		in every aspect of vehicle performance. Ranked first in number of crashes avoided, 
		parallels parked, and highest amount of quarts of gasoline consumed just to name a few.
		These seem may seem like unpossible feats for only one car to accomplish, yet the 
		Deslizador Malo Gato makes antipossible become likely. The first step to acquiring 
		this high performance supercar is 2500 payments of $19.99 plus $25 shipping and handling.

		<p id="brand">Italics Formaggio 
		<br> $73,000</p>
		<p id="description">The Italian Stallion, the Venice Menace, the Sicilian 
		Maximilian, the Italics Formaggio was iconic for its time. This force of nature in
		the form of a compact red rocket rolled onto the streets of Italy decades ago, yet
		even back then there wasn't a single roadster out there that could measure up to its 
		huge potential. The curved spoiler applies an immense amount of downforce to balance 
		the air stream created by the aerodynamic hood which is needed to compensate for the 
		large retractable headlights that give at least 75 extra horsepower. This is the sports
		coupe that defined a generation, and now it's back with a vengeance. 63432.98 euros is 
		a small price to pay when owning a piece of automotive history.

		<p id="brand">Yeep Lhongboi
		<br> $23,000</p>
		<p id="description"> A marvel of Nigerian engineering, the Yeep Lhongboi is the
		next step in the evolution of SUVs. This is a Scansorial Ubiquarian Vessel like 
		no other. Most offroading vehicles come with suspension upgrades, more durable 
		tires, or a lifted suspension. The Lhongboi has all of that and more. Nigerian 
		science has fused two Yeep Biegbois to form one Lhongboi, which now covers a 
		larger square footage enabling it to traverse a larger area. There is no terrain, 
		no obstacle, no first or final frontier that the Lhongboi can't handle. With the 
		overwhelming power of its v10 engine you can go anywhere, at anytime, with anyone,
		anyway you want. All you need to do is pay 8404660.27 Nigerian naira, or $23,000 
		US dollars plus shipping and handling.

		<p id="brand">Magnum Bolt: Super Special Awesome Edition
		<br> $2,500,000</p>
		<p id="description">The Super Special Awesome Edition Magnum Bolt is one of the 
		world's fastest vans, with a top speed of 5000 yards per minute.
		This huge beast of a machine is 100,000 ounces of raw power, launching
		you from zero to sixty in a blink of an eye. They only made 7 of these		
		majestic monsters, and for good reason. Gathering all 7 in the same spot
		summons the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl who will grant the owner unlimited 
		control over bananas. Obviously this raw power is too much for any mortal
		to control, so each one was scattered to the edges of the Earth. On top of 
		This the Magnum Bolt comes built in with a 55 inch flat screen and a Playstation
		7. The Magnum Bolt is truly a gift to humanity, and you can own one for the 
		reasonable price of 50,000,000 nickels.
